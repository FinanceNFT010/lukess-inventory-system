# Lukess Inventory System — Core Rules

## Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript strict, Supabase, Tailwind CSS v3
- Deployment: Vercel | DB: PostgreSQL via Supabase

## Architecture (CRITICAL)
- Route groups: `(auth)/` = login | `(dashboard)/` = main app
- Route groups DO NOT appear in URLs
- Server Components by default — add `'use client'` only when strictly necessary
- Never create `app/page.tsx` — root is `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`

## Code Rules
- Always use TypeScript strict — never use `any`
- Error handling: try/catch with `toast.error()` + `console.error()`
- Loading states: `const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)`
- Always filter by `org_id` in every Supabase query (RLS)
- Helper: `get_user_org_id()` available for all org queries

## Design System
- Colors: blue=metrics | green=inventory/success | purple=financial | red=alerts/delete
- Buttons: gradient `from-blue-600 to-purple-600 text-white` for primary actions
- Cards: `bg-{color}-50 border-2 border-{color}-200 rounded-xl p-6`
- Icons: lucide-react only
- NEVER: text-white on bg-white | colored text on same color bg

## Commits
- After each completed feature: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: description" && git push origin main`
